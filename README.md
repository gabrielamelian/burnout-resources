### Burnout representation in media

These are just some cool episodes or movies that I think have a good representation of burnout and its consequences.

* [Star Trek Lower Decks, season 1 episode 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9207520/?ref_=ttep_ep3): I loved how they represented the fact that people need rest in order to do a good job. The ending is not the greatest but the overall message is good.
* [Kiki Delivery Service](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097814/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0): This movie is just beautiful, but what I liked is how it showed that when you don't believe in what you're doing or you're feeling down, you become unable to perform at work.
